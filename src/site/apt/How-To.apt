Using the GSF in your project

    Adding the GSF to your project does not require any special setup or configuration. To begin leveraging the features of <<gsf-core>>, simply add <<gsf-core-VERSION.jar>> to your project's Java classpath.

Use the OOTB Factory Producer and Factory Implementations

	* GSF object factories are very powerful and allow you to leverage inversion of control by configuring your application in a central location.  GSF 12 introduces the concept of <<scoped factories>>:
	
	* GSF requires 2 scoped factories at all times, one for each scope driving WCS (and the GSF itself):
	
		* ICS scope and
		
		* ServletContext scope.
		
		[]
	
	* Base factory implementations are provided for each scope, out-of-the-box:
	
		* ICS scope: <<tools.gsf.config.IcsBackedFactory>>

		* ServletContext scope: <<tools.gsf.config.ServletContextBackedFactory>>
		
		[]
		
	* Factory Producer is responsible for instantiating all scoped factories supporting the system. A base factory producer implementation is provided, out-of-the-box: DefaultFactoryProducer.

	* A <<fallback mechanism>> enables the GSF automatically looking up an object in the ServletContext-scoped factory whenever it is not found in the ICS-scoped factory. <<DefaultFactoryProducer>> is responsible for wiring up such fallback mechanism, e.g. by making ServletContextBackedFactory the <<"delegate" factory>> of IcsBackedFactory. 
		
	* No settings / tweaks are required in order to use the built-in Factory Producer (DefaultFactoryProducer). GSF will default to it unless you configure a custom Factory Producer.
	
	* No settings / tweaks are required in order to use the built-in scoped Factories, provided that:
	
		* You are using the DefaultFactoryProducer, and
		
		* You are not using any custom built factories instead of the OOTB ones.
		
		[]
		
	* You can easily retrieve your ICS-scoped factory instance in one line:
	
+--
Factory myIcsScopedFactory = FactoryLocator.locateFactory(ics);  // ics is your ICS instance
+-- 

	* If, for whatever reason, you needed to get ahold of the ServletContext-scoped factory (remember that magical fallback mechanism), you can easily do so:

+--
FactoryProducer fp = FactoryProducer.locateFactoryProducer(servletContext); // servletContext is your ServletContext instance
Factory myServletContextScopedFactory = fp.getFactory(servletContext);
+-- 

	* In theory, you can even define your own "scopes", as long as you comply with the due interfaces / contract.
	
		* GSF does not know how to delegate from any custom scopes onto the built-in ones (nor viceversa). It's your responsibility defining your own Factory implementation's lookup logic as well as the due delegation strategy -- perhaps, supported by a custom Factory Producer implementation, too.
		
		[]
			
	[] 
		
Use Your Own Factory Implementation

	* Implement your own custom factory.
	
		* Typically, you'll want to extend either <<tools.gsf.config.IcsBackedFactory>> or <<tools.gsf.config.ServletContextBackedFactory>> .
		
		* The only true requisite is that you implement the <<tools.gsf.config.Factory>> interface.
		
		* There are other factories you could either extend or reuse (for instance, SpringObjectFactory)
						
		[]
	
	* Register it:
	
		[[1]] Create a file named "gsf-factory".
		
		[[1]] Inside your "gsf-factory" file, specify the fully-qualified name of your custom factory class(es).
		
			* For overriding the default ICS-scoped factory, add a line like this:

+--
COM.FutureTense.Interfaces.ICS:foo.wee.whatever.MyCustomIcsBackedFactory
+--

			* For overriding the default ServletContext-scoped factory, add a line like this:

+--
javax.servlet.ServletContext:foo.wee.whatever.MyCustomServletContextBackedFactory
+--

			[]

		[[1]] Package that file inside the "META-INF" folder of any JAR you are deploying inside the WCS 12c web app.
		
			* Typically, you'd put it inside your custom JAR file (e.g. the one containing the custom factory producer class itself).
			
			[]
		
		[[1]] Deploy the JAR file containing your "gsf-factory" file inside the WCS web app.
			
		[]
		
	* BEAR IN MIND:
	
		* GSF requires (at least) 2 factories, one for each supported <<scope>>:
		
			* COM.FutureTense.Interfaces.ICS (a.k.a. "ICS" scope) and
			
			* javax.servlet.ServletContext (a.k.a. "ServletContext" scope).
			
		* GSF's <<built-in fallback mechanism>> enables its looking up an object in the ServletContext-scoped factory whenever it is not found in the ICS-scoped factory.
					
		* If you don't explicitly configure a factory for these 2 scopes via "gsf-factory" file, they will default to:
		
+--
COM.FutureTense.Interfaces.ICS:tools.gsf.config.IcsBackedFactory
javax.servlet.ServletContext:tools.gsf.config.ServletContextBackedFactory
+--
	
		[]		
		
	[]

Use the @ServiceProducer Annotation (tools.gsf.config.ServiceProducer)

	* This annotation supports the <<AbstractDelegatingFactory>> base class for factory implementations.

	* This annotation will identify a method as a Service Producer. A service producer is a method that creates an object that is returned by the factory class.
	
	* Service Producer methods are meaningful only to subclasses of <<AbstractDelegatingFactory>>
	
	* This annotation provides the following settings:
	
		* <<cache>> (OPTIONAL): indicates if the object should be cached or not. It defaults to <<false>>.
		
		* <<name>> (OPTIONAL): the "name" of the Service. It's an "alias" for the method's prototype, used by factories when looking up an object. It defaults to an empty string.
		
		[]
		
	* Lookup logic and limitations:
	
		* The <<Factory.getObject(String name, Class<T> type)>> method ultimately provide the ability to look up or retrieve an object from the factory. The mechanism by which this lookup occurs is up to the implementation to decide.

		* <<AbstractDelegatingFactory>>'s subclasses, like <<IcsBackedFactory>> and <<ServletContextBackedFactory>> utilize the following lookup mechanism:.
		
		* Fallback from "named" ServiceProducer methods onto "unnamed" ServiceProducer methods is provided OOTB, meaning:
		
			* Factory.getObject(objectName, type) looks across all "named" Service Producers (i.e. methods where @ServiceProducer.name != null):
			
				* If a method is found, then that's the method producing the object to be returned, lookup finishes.
				
				* Otherwise, Factory.getObject(objectName, type) looks across all "unnamed" Service Producers (i.e. methods where @ServiceProducer.name == null):
				
					* If the object is found, that's the object that gets injected.
				
					* Otherwise, Factory.getObject(objectName, type) returns:
					
						* If there is a delegate factory: delegateFactory.getObject().
						
							* OOTB, IcsBackedFactory delegates into ServletContextBackedFactory.
							
							[]
					
						* If there is not a delegate factory: null.
						
						[]
						
					[] 
				
				[]
			
			[]

		* Whenever you specify a ServiceProducer.name for a given method in your factory class, make sure it is unique -- including all inherited methods.
		
		* Although specifying ServiceProducer.name is optional, you are advised to specify it for every Service Producer or, at the very least, for all Service Producers whose return type is the same; this will avoid ambiguity and, potentially, unexpected results from your factory's "getObject" method.
		
			* This is especially relevant when your own factory inherits other Service Producers with the same return type from an existing factory it extends.
			
			* Unless you really know what you are doing, avoid overriding inherited Service Producers.
			
			[] 
			
		[]

	* Example:
	
+--
(...)

@ServiceProducer
public Stopwatch newStopwatch() {
    return LoggerStopwatch.getInstance();
}

(...)
+--
	
	(NOTE: you can find multiple examples inside the IcsBackedFactory and ServletContextBackedFactory classes)	
	
	[]

Use the @InjectForRequest Annotation (tools.gsf.config.inject.InjectForRequest)

	* This annotation will look up the specified object (bean / service) in the configured <<ics-scoped>> Factory and it will inject it into the annotated field / method.
	
	* It provides the following settings:
	
		* <<value>> (OPTIONAL): the "name" of the object (bean / service) to be looked up.  If not specified, "value" will default to:
		
			* Case annotated field: the name of the annotated field.
			
			* Case annotated method: output of org.springframework.beans.BeanUtils.findPropertyForMethod(method).getName().
			
			[] 
		
		[]

	* Example:
	
+--
(...)

/**
 * Provide a DAO that allows an asset to be easily mapped
 */
@InjectForRequest
protected TemplateAssetAccess templateAssetAccess;

(...)
+--
	
	[]

Use the @Bind Annotation (tools.gsf.config.inject.Bind)

	* This annotation will look for the specified variable in the specified scope ("ics", "request" or "session") and, if found, it will inject the value into the annotated field.
	
	* It provides the following settings:
	
		* <<value>> (OPTIONAL): the name of the variable we want to look up. It defaults to the name of the annotated field. 
		
		* <<scope>> (OPTIONAL): the scope in which we want to look up. Supported values are "ics", "request" and "session". It defaults to "ics".
		
		[]
		
	* Lookup logic and limitations:
	
		* When the <<extracted object is a String>>:
		
			* If the annotated field's type is String, then it will assign the object as-is.
			
			* If the annotated field's type <<is primitive (byte, int, double, float, long, short or boolean)>>, then conversion is attempted.
				
			* If the annotated field's type <<is String, Date, Integer, Double, Character or Long>>, then conversion is attempted.
				
			* If the annotate field's type is none of the above, it will try to assign the object to the annotated field as-is (no conversion). If the object is not assignable, an exception will be thrown.
				
			[]
				  			
		* When the <<extracted object is NOT a String>>:
		
			* If the annotated field's type <<is primitive (byte, int, double, float, long, short or boolean)>>, then conversion is attempted.
				
			* If the annotated field's type is of any other type, no value gets injected, annotation has no effect, no exception is thrown.
				
			[]
			
		[]
		
	* Example:
	
+--
(...)

/**
 * Bind rendermode to local variable
 */
@Bind(value="rendermode")
protected String myRenderMode;

(...)
+--

Use the @CurrentAsset Annotation (tools.gsf.facade.assetapi.asset.CurrentAsset)

	* This brand new annotation determines the current asset for the current ICS object (e.g. via c + cid), loads the asset along with the value of the attributes specified by the annotation and injects the appropriate object into the annotated field. 
	
	* It provides the following settings:
	
		* <<attributes>> (OPTIONAL): the "name" of the attributes whose values we want to pre-load for the current asset. If not specified, "value" will default to "name" (meaning the std field on every asset type / subtype named "name")

		[]
		
	* Lookup logic and limitations:
	
		* Current asset is determined as per the following call: AssetIdUtils.currentId(ics).
		
		* Supports TemplateAsset, ScatteredAsset and AssetData typed fields. Asset containers provided by other DAOs may be configured by overriding the <<CurrentAssetInjector>> class.
		
		[]
		
	* IMPORTANT: be aware of the language-specific convention for specifying String arrays (Groovy = [], Java = {})
		
	* Examples (Groovy):
		
			* TemplateAsset:
			
+--

class MyController extends InjectingController {
	
	(...)
 
	@CurrentAsset(attributes=["title", "body", "headline"]) TemplateAsset currentTemplateAsset;
 
	protected void handleRequest() {
		String headline = currentAsset.asString("headline");
		
		(...)
	}
 	
	(...)
 
}

+--

			* ScatteredAsset:
			
+--

class AnotherController extends InjectingController {

	(...)

	@CurrentAsset(attributes=["title", "body", "headline"]) ScatteredAsset currentScatteredAsset;

	protected void handleRequest() {
		models.add("asset", currentScatteredAsset);
		
		(...)
	}
	
	(...)

}

+--

			* AssetData:
			
+--

class ThirdController extends InjectingController {

	(...)

	@CurrentAsset(attributes=["title", "body", "headline"]) AssetData currentAssetData;
	
	protected void handleRequest() {
		AttributeData ad = currentAssetData.getAttribute("title");
		
		(...)

	}
	
	(...)

}

+--

			[]
			
		[]
			
	[]
	
Use the @Mapping Annotation (tools.gsf.mapping.Mapping)

	* This annotation will look up a map entry matching the specified key in the Template / CSElement being executed (for the current site) and, if found, it will inject the mapped value into the annotated field. 
	
	* It provides the following settings:
	
		* <<match>> (OPTIONAL): the "side" of the mapped value you want to (retrieve and) inject. Supported values are "all" (equivalent to "x"), "right" (equivalent to ":x") and "left" (equivalent to "x:"). It defaults to "all".
		
		* <<value>> (OPTIONAL): the key of the map entry whose value we want to retrieve. It defaults to the name of the annotated field.
		
		[]
		
	* Lookup logic and limitations:
	
		* If the eid (/ tid) of the CSElement (/ Template) being executed cannot be determined, then the annotation has no effect, no exception is thrown.
		
		* Only fields of the following types can use this annotation (conversion is done automatically at runtime):
		
			* tools.gsf.mapping.MappingValue (applicable to all map entry types: <asset type: asset id>, template name, ...)
			
			* com.fatwire.assetapi.data.AssetId (applicable only to <asset type: asset id> map entries)
			
			* tools.gsf.mapping.AssetName (applicable only to <asset type: asset name> map entries)
			
			* String (applicable to all map entry types)   
	
			[]
			
		* The "match" setting is only relevant when the annotated field's type is String.

		* If a map entry matching the specified key and site is found, but it doesn't have a valid (and assignable) value, then an Exception is thrown.
		
		* Controllers can only be bound to SiteEntry and Template assets, not CSElements. However, map entries can only be specified for Template and CSElements. Hence:
		
			* You can use this annotation for mapping Template-specific map entries onto a Controller's field if you call the Template using style="embedded" or style="pagelet".
			
				* When a Template is called with style="element", no Controller gets invoked.
				
				[]
		 	
			* You can use this annotation for mapping CSElement-specific map entries onto a Controller's field if you invoke the CSElement via the SiteEntry the Controller is bound to.
			
				* If you call the CSElement directly, no Controller gets invoked.
				
				[]
				
			[]
				
		* This annotation only works if the "pagename" of the Template / SiteEntry being executed is accessible (at runtime) from within the Controller (i.e. via the ICS "pagename" variable).
		
			* This is due exclusively to a bug in WCS 12c's rendering logic which prevents eid / tid from being accessible at runtime from within Controllers bound to a SiteEntry(+CSELement) / Template asset.
			
			[] 
		
		[]
		
	* Example:
	
+--
(...)

/**
 * Bind map entry's value to local variable
 */
@Mapping(value="myMappedAsset")
protected String mappedAsset;

(...)
+--
	
	[]
	
Use Your Own Asset Type as a GST Property Asset

	* Implement your own object factory and add to it a <<Service Producer method>> (i.e. annotated with @ServiceProducer) which instantiates the new <<com.fatwire.gst.foundation.properties.AssetApiPropertyDao>>.
	
	* Example:
	
+--

@ServiceProducer(cache = true)
public PropertyDao instantiateCustomPropertyDao(final ICS ics) {
	Session session = SessionFactory.getSession(ics);
	AssetDataManager adm = (AssetDataManager) session.getManager(AssetDataManager.class.getName());
	SiteManager sm = (SiteManager) session.getManager(SiteManager.class.getName());
	String type = "MyCustomAssetType";
	String flexDefName = "MyCustomFlexDefName";
	String propNameAttr = "nameOfAttributeToGetThePropertyNameFrom"; \\ Typically "name"
	String propDescAttr = "nameOfAttributeToGetThePropertyDescriptionFrom"; \\ Typically "description"
	String propValueAttr = "nameOfAttributeToGetThePropertyValueFrom"; \\ Typically "value"
	return new AssetApiPropertyDao(adm, sm, type, flexDefName, propNameAttr, propDescAttr, propValueAttr, ics);
}

+--

Make Your Own Beans / Objects Available for Injection
				
	See "Use a Custom Asset Type as a GST Property Asset" and "Implement (and Use) Your Own NavService Implementation" above.
	
	In general, all you need to do is implement your own object factory and make your custom bean available by adding the due Service Producer (annotated) method to it.

Inject Your Own Beans / Objects Into a WCS 12c Controller

	* Instead of extending WCS 12c's <<BaseController>> class, have your controller extend the GSF's <<tools.gsf.controller.InjectingController>> instead. It is simple and lightweight but provides injection support to your standard <<doWork(Map models)>> method..
	
		If you are curious (or suspicious) as to how this works, look at the source code for GSF's <<InjectingController.java>>. It's trivially short.
				
	* <<A VERY IMPORTANT NOTE (WARNING) ON style="element" IN WCS 12c>>.
	
		WCS 12c will not invoke your Template's controller if you invoke your template using a render:calltemplate tag call with style="element".
		
		In such scenario, if your Template's code depended on its own Controller's logic (which is usually the case), it would break.
		
		Previous versions of the GSF defaulted to style="element" when Type 1 controllers called the childpagename template (in an attempt to intelligently set the call's style whenever you didn't set it explicitly).
		
		This did not occur in WCS 11.x and previous versions since Controllers were just introduced in WCS 12c.
		
		If you are using the <<GST/Dispatcher wrapper>>, <<GSF actions>> or any other LEGACY (hence deprecated) feature related to those two, be aware that combining those with the use of WCS 12c Controllers may yield erratic behaviour for the same reason.
		
		You can work around this by:
		
			[[1]] Making sure all Layout Templates ever invoked via the GST/Dispatcher (e.g. GSF actions) are set to "cached", hence preventing GSF's LEGACY CallTemplate Facade from automatically setting style="element" for you, OR
			
			[[1]] Avoiding the use of Layout Template which rely on Controllers attached to them in conjunction with GSF Actions and/or GST/Dispatcher.
			
			[]
			
		In addition to this, if you really need to use GSF Actions AND Controllers, here are some ideas to minimize chance of your CallTemplate calls breaking (DISCLAIMER: as per the above explanation, these may not cover you 100%):			
															
			[[A]] Adjust all of your calls to <<gsf-legacy>>'s CallTemplate facade so to set "style" explicitly to something other than "element" whenever the called Template has a Controller attached to it.
			
			[[A]] Use <<gsf-core>>'s (new) CallTemplate facade (instead of LEGACY's), which forces your explicitly setting "style" on each call, and make sure you set style to the appropriate value, as per the aforementioned considerations.

		From the above, you've probably figured out already that GSF deals with the potential chaos this style-related behaviour could cause on pre-existing code you attempt migrating to WCS 12c's Controller-based paradigm simply by getting rid of the "legacy" intelligence.
		
		This implies there are now 2 CallTemplate facades:
		
			* The new one, which ships with the CORE artifact / JAR. In this one, style will NEVER be autocalculated for you. Either you set it explicitly - to the appropriate value - on each call or an Exception will be thrown.
			
			* The old one, which ships with the LEGACY artifact / JAR. This one has been left untouched, which means the style auto-selection intelligence is still there, with all that implies.
			
			[]

JUST A TAD MORE ADVANCED

Use Your Own Factory Producer Implementation

	* Implement your own custom factory producer.
	
		* You can extend the existing DefaultFactoryProducer class.
		
		* Otherwise, make sure your own class implements the <<tools.gsf.config.FactoryProducer>> interface.
		
		[]
	
	* Register it, in one of the following ways: 
	
		[[1]] Via META-INF/gsf-factory-producer:
		
			[[A]] Create a file named "gsf-factory-producer".
			
			[[A]] Inside the file, add a line with the fully-qualified name of your custom factory producer class, as in:
		
+--
com.mycompany.wcs.gsf.config.MyCustomFactoryProducer
+--

			[[A]] Package that file inside the "META-INF" folder of any JAR you are deploying inside the WCS 12c web app.
			
				* Typically, you'd put it inside your custom JAR file (e.g. the one containing the custom factory producer class itself).
				
				[]

			[[A]] Deploy the JAR file containing your "gsf-factory-producer" file inside the WCS web app.
			
			[]
			
		[[1]] Via web.xml:
		
			[[A]] Inside your WCS 12c web app's web.xml descriptor, add a context-param called "gsf-factory-producer" and specify the fully-qualified classname of your factory producer class. For example:
			
+--
<context-param>    
   <param-name>gsf-factory-producer</param-name>
   <param-value>com.mycompany.wcs.gsf.config.MyCustomFactoryProducer</param-value>
</context-param>
+--				
		
			[[A]] Redeploy (and restart) the WCS 12c web app so it picks up the updated web.xml descriptor.
			
			[]
			
		[]
		
	[]

Use Your Own NavService Implementation

	* Implement your own object factory.
	
	* Make your custom bean / object available by having a Service Producer method in your own object factory instantiate it:
		
		* In case you have <<extended>> IcsObjectFactory, you probably want to override the existing <<"createNavService">> method.
		
		* In case you have not extended IcsObjectFactory, you must add the due Service Producer method to your own implementation; for example: 
	
+--

@ServiceProducer(cache = true)
public NavService<AssetNode> createNavService(final ICS ics) {
    TemplateAssetAccess dao = getObject("templateAssetAccess", TemplateAssetAccess.class);
    return new MyCustomNavServiceImplementation(ics, dao);
}

+--
		
		[]
		
	[]
	
Use Your Own NavigationNode Implementation

	This one depends on what "using your own NavigationNode implementation" means to you:
	
	* If you literally want to use your own <<Node>> implementation, then doing so requires your implementing your own <<NavService>>, too.
	
		* You can either implement your own NavService from scratch or extend the existing ones (see <<SitePlanNavService>> or <<LightweightSitePlanNavService>>)
	
		* Plugging in your own NavService is simple (see above)
	
	* If you are using one of the OOTB NavService implementations and you just want each <<AssetNode>> to be pre-populated with additional data other than the asset's "name" and "template", then you just need to override the <<"populateNodeData">> method.
	
	[]

BUILDING AND CONTRIBUTING TO THE GSF

Prepare your local MAVEN repository

	In order to build and package the GSF project, first you must ensure all artifacts can be found by your MAVEN install.

	Unfortunately, at the time of this release, Oracle had not yet set up a public MAVEN repository where WCS 12c's own JAR files - i.e. those starting with "sites-*" - can be found (as MAVEN artifacts) by the general public.

	For that reason, the (only) artifacts you'll most likely be missing are those concerning WCS 12c's own JAR files.

	Hence, in order to build the GSF, you must either:

	*	Deploy all missing MAVEN artifacts onto your local MAVEN repository and/or

	*	Create all missing MAVEN artifacts in your own remote MAVEN repository (for ex.: artifactory) and make sure your local MAVEN install gets them from such repository.

	[]

	The strategy we've opted for is treating each sites-* JAR file as a separate artifact.

	This allows our streamlining the list of dependencies for each pom in the GSF project and, thus, reducing the total build time.

	It also provides better visibility of the actual dependencies of each GSF artifact -- i.e. CORE's and LEGACY's.

	Note that we are building only against WCS 12c's artifacts / JARs. GSF version 12 <<is not and will not be compatible with previous versions of WCS>>.

	All other artifacts referenced by the GSF's POMs are public, available from standard locations.

Build and Package the GSF Project

	Once you've set up MAVEN locally (one-timer), you'd be all set for building the GSF artifacts.

	Building (and packaging) the GSF artifacts is <<very easy>>; just execute the package.sh shell script located in the project's root folder:

+--
$ sh package.sh
+--

	This will:

		[[1]] Download all due MAVEN artifacts

		[[1]] Build the entire MAVEN project, including both CORE and LEGACY submodules / components.

		[[1]] Build the GSF website.

		[[1]] Package all of the above in 2 separate files: the GSF "KIT" and the GSF "SITE".

		[]

	The script is quite verbose; hence, it should be trivial understanding what it is doing and where you can pick up the output (files)

	In addition to the default behaviour, you also have the ability to invoke just one part of the whole packaging process:

		* <<"sh package.sh jar">>: this will download the artifacts and build the project (e.g. produce the JARs), but it won't generate the website, package it nor will it package the Kit.

		* <<"sh package.sh kit">>: this will package the GSF Kit for you, but it will not build the project for you (e.g. it won't re-compile the code)

		* <<"sh package.sh site">>: this will package the GSF Website for you, but it will not build the project nor package the GSF Kit for you.

		* <<"sh package.sh all">>: this is the default behaviour, i.e. it is <<equivalent to "sh package.sh">>.

		[]

	If you want MAVEN to include a timestamp on every line it outputs, make sure you configure MAVEN accordingly. You can find useful information {{{https://maven.apache.org/maven-logging.html} here}}.
