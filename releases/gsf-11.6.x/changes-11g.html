    Forward-port of changes from GSF 1.3.1.  NOT TESTED.  KIT CHANGES NOT YET PORTED (E.G. DOC STRUCTURE ETC).

    Re-name GSF version to version 11.0
    
    The facades package version number did not align with the rest of the
    GSF, so it had to be incremented.  Rather than incrementing the whole
    GSF to version 3, it is being incremented to 11 to align with WebCenter
    Sites.
    
    Sites patch levels etc. will be addressed later.

Author: Dolf Dijkstra

    Refactored the UrlRegistry implementation. Made a new UrlRegistry2 table. added a Dao and implementation for the table access. Added a VanityUrl domain object.
    Created a SimpleWra domain: a simplification for web referencable assets without the h1title, meta attributes, just the path,startdate and enddate.
    Refactored the WraAssetEventListener to extend RunOnceAssetListener to prevent duplicate execution.


Author: Dolf Dijkstra 
Date:   Wed Nov 2 13:34:54 2011 +0000

    Implemented a RunOnce event listener, that will prevent business logic execution if that business logic has already fired for this event listener during this ICS scope (request). For publishing and asset save this is sufficient.

Author: Tony Field 
Date:   Wed Sep 21 04:50:31 2011 +0000

    Added a handy tag to do translation lookups based on a dimensionset after commercecontext.getrecommendation tag calls.  A companion tag that takes a single asset as input is probably warranted.  Typical syntax for this new tag is:
    
                                                                &lt;commercecontext:getrecommendations collectionid='${tag.id}' listvarname=&quot;reclist&quot;/&gt;
                                                                &lt;gsf:translate-list inlist=&quot;reclist&quot; dimset=&quot;EEGlobal&quot; /&gt;
    
    The tag is smart and forgiving, and trivial to implement. For instance, outlist is optional (replacing inlist).  dimset can be either a dimensionset name or id.  locale is optional, an can be either a dimension id, a locale name, or, if not set, is auto-detected in ics as a variable, session variable, or the accept-language header.  Detailed logging explains what's going on.
    
    Added required support infrastructure to LocaleUtils and DimensionUtils.

    Adding NPE protection.


Author: Tony Field 
Date:   Sat Sep 3 02:26:09 2011 +0000

    Added &quot;property&quot; support.  Asset type called GSTProperty, having name, description, value attributes, can now be loaded into memory and accessed by name inside a JSP via EL.  Useful for constants, hard-coded values, etc. that need to be accessed in a web page.
    
    Installation is not yet in place. (needs a flex asset, flex definition, and an attribute called &quot;value&quot;).
    
    Translation support should be added at some point (maybe?) and properties of type asset do not currently track any sort of dependency.  (Not sure if this is a problem or not).
    
    NOTE: This currently loads a cache dependency for all properties any time a single dependency is accessed.  This needs to be fixed.
    
    Tag support is basic for now.
    
    All tags tested by me.
